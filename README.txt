Genetic Algorithm Project
CSCI 6635 - Pattern Recogition

You need to develop a Genetic Algorithm (GA) (or, any other heuristics based
nondeterministic approach) based structural search algorithms. The algorithm for a given
sequences will search for the best conformation or will go for minimum Energy
conformation and it will visually show or draw the best conformation found in each
generations or in each steps along with the computed fitness value.
